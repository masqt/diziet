Masqt Flutter front-end for Android and iOS.

## Getting Started

1. You'll need to install Flutter, if you don't already have it on your machine.
Follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
for your operating system, including setting up an editor.

1. Copy the `env.example` file in this directory to a new file called `.env`.
(We use environment variables to configure our builds for dev/test/staging/prod.)

1. Run `flutter doctor` and fix any important problems that it mentions.

1. optionally, run `flutter test`, which should tell you whether tests are working. 

1. Open the project directory and get hacking!
