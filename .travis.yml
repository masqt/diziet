  # Clone Flutter
  # We clone the Flutter beta branch. You should clone whatever branch
  # you know works for building production apps.
  # If in doubt, you are advised to use the stable branch of Flutter
  # for production apps and you would do this by changing -b beta to -b stable
  # but we started the project before stable existed and whilst beta has always
  # worked reasonably well for us and we find stable is usually too outdated
  # and has too many missing framework features.
  - git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b beta --depth 1

  # Add Flutter to the PATH environment variable.
  - export PATH=`pwd`/flutter/bin:`pwd`/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin:$PATH

  # Pipe environment variables into a .env file so that Flutter can find it
  - env > ./.env

script:
  # Print the Flutter version so that we know it's working correctly
  - flutter doctor -v

  # Run tests
  - flutter test

  # Run the Flutter Android build
  # TODO: Fix this --- it's not finding the artifacts it needs and I don't have the time to fix it now
  # - flutter build apk
